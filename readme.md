## Requirements ##

OS X 10.8.x (Mountain Lion) or higher

## Description ##

In Mountain Lion (10.8), Apple introduced a utility called "Caffeinate" that basically replicates what the Caffeine utility ([web](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) | [app store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225) from [Lighthead Software](http://lightheadsw.com/) does.

## Installation ##
Download the [workflow](http://www.packal.org/workflow/caffeinate-control) file and double click it.

## Commands ##

Just type `caff` to get started. It will tell you the status and give you the most relevant option first.

Otherwise: 
  - `caff e` enables caffeinate indefinitely
  - `caff d` disables caffeinate
  - `caff 2 15` enables caffeinate for 15 hours and 2 minutes
  - `caff 23` enables caffeinate for 23 minutes
  - `caff 2h` enables caffeinate for 2 hours
  - `caff configure` opens the configuration dialog
  - `caff help` opens the help dialog.
